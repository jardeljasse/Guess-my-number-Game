# Guess-my-number-Game
I'm happy to share with you the little project game, known as 'guess my number'

### How It Works 🤔  

▶ First, you need to guess the number that the computer will generate within a range of [1-20].  

You can choose the range you would like to guess.  

You have a **"Play Again"** button to restart the game.  

🎯 **Tips:** Yes, you have hints to help you!  
   - When you try to guess the number, if your guess is incorrect, the computer will guide you by indicating whether your number is too high or too low compared to the correct number.  

🥉🥳 You can see your score and best score.  

### Features Used  

1️⃣ **Strict Mode**  
   - I used **"Strict Mode"** to catch small errors that would otherwise be ignored in non-strict mode. For example, assigning a value to an undeclared variable would result in an error instead of being treated as an implicit global variable.  
   - **Strict Mode** is a JavaScript feature that helps write cleaner, more secure, and optimized code by preventing common mistakes and the use of problematic or deprecated features.  

2️⃣ **Beginning of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**  
   - **DRY** stands for **"Don't Repeat Yourself"**, a fundamental principle in software development aimed at reducing code duplication.  
   - The goal is to avoid repetitive code by abstracting common functionality into reusable components such as functions, modules, or classes.
